## 📌 Project Overview 

This project applies a neural network to predict life expectancy based on various socio-economic and health-related factors. 
The model is implemented in Python using TensorFlow/Keras, and the dataset is processed using Pandas and NumPy. 
The goal is to explore the relationship between these factors and life expectancy through deep learning.
The model is trained to predict life expectancy with a regression approach. The performance is evaluated using metrics like Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R-squared (R²).
